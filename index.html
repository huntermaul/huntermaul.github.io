    <h1>Hunter Maul (he/him)</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a creative technologist, designer and artist based in Boulder, CO. 
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Creative Technology and 
        Design with a minor in Environmental Design from the University of Colorado 
        at Boulder. My mission is to leverage innovative technologies and design 
        to create a more sustainable and equitable world for all.</p>
    <h2>Course Goals</h2>
    <p>In this course I would like to establish a foundational knowledge of
        web design and determine whether or not it is something that I would
        like to pursue further within my career!
